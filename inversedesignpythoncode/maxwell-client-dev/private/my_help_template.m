%%% Introduction to Maxopt
% The |maxopt| family of functions, examples, and cases lives on top of 
% the |maxwell| functions 
% and implements basic structural optimization functions and examples.

%%% Maxopt functions
% These functions enable gradient-based optimization schemes.
<<<maxopt_functions>>>

%%% Maxopt examples
% Various optimization examples. 
% The various optimization methods showcased include 
% brute-force parameter sweep, derivative-free search, and gradient-descent.

%%% Maxopt cases 
% These cases are used in the Maxopt examples and show how structures can be
% set up for optimization.
